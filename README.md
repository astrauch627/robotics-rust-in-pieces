<br/>Notes on Deliverable #3:
<br/>Run "Python V-REP"/main.py to kick off simulation with forward kinematics.
<br/>
<br/>Notes on Deliverable #2:
<br/>The first YouTube video was made from changing the code in the V-REP scene we created for this deliverable, "V-REP Scenes"/initial_motion.ttt
<br/>The second YouTube video (the one with side-by-side with the Python output window) was created from another V-REP scene that was created for this deliverable, "V-REP Scenes"/intitial_motion_python.ttt
<br/>We have shown that we can connect to V-REP through external python code written in "Python V-REP"/vrep_main_python.py and this code also shows that we can access readings from a proximity sensor. To run this code, first open the V-REP Scene, "V-REP Scenes"/initial_motion_python.ttt in V-REP and run the simulation. Then, "Python V-REP"/vrep_main_python.py can be run. Connection status and sensor readings are output while this program runs.
