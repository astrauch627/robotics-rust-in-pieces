Notes on Deliverable #2:
The YouTube video was made from changing the code in the V-REP scene we created for this deliverable, "V-REP Scenes"/initial_motion.ttt
We have shown that we can connect to V-REP through external python code written in "Python V-REP"/vrep_main_python.py and this code also shows that we can access readings from a proximity sensor. To run this code, first open the V-REP Scene, "V-REP Scenes"/initial_motion_python.ttt in V-REP and run the simulation. Then, "Python V-REP"/vrep_main_python.py can be run. Connection status and sensor readings are output while this program runs.
